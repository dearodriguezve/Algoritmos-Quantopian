"""
This algorithm demonstrates the concept of long-short equity. It uses a
combination of factors to construct a ranking of securities in a liquid
tradable universe. It then goes long on the highest-ranked securities and short
on the lowest-ranked securities.

For information on long-short equity strategies, please see the corresponding
lecture on our lectures page:

https://www.quantopian.com/lectures

This algorithm was developed as part of Quantopian's Lecture Series. Please
direct and questions, feedback, or corrections to feedback@quantopian.com
